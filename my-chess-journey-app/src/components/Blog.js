            <h2>My thoughts On the Petroff Defense </h2>
            <p>The Petroff Defense is one of my least favorite openings. However, I do think the Stafford Gambit, which one of my favorite players Eric Rosen often utilizes in blitz games, can be fun to play.</p>
            <p>The Petroff Defense is characterized by the following: 1. e4 1... e5 2. Nf3 2... Nf6 </p>
            <p>While I don't particularly care for the Petroff Defense, as I regularly play e4 it is something I need more preparation on. I'll likely see it many more times in the future.</p>
